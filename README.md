## Digital Twin: Scene & Object Movements
We annotate object movements by labeling temporal segments from pick-up to placement and 2D bounding boxes at movement onset and end. Tracks include even slight shifts/pushes, ensuring full coverage of movements. Every object movement is annotated and assgin to a scene fixture, providing a rich dataset for analysis. Movements of the same object are then grouped into "associations" by human annotators. This association data is stored across two JSON files. The first (`scene-and-object-movements/assoc_info.json`) is a JSON object where the keys are video names and the values are groupings of each object's movements throughout the video (referred to as "associations"). The structure for this file is as follows:
```jsonc
{
  "video_id": {
    "association_id": {
      "name": "string",
      "tracks": [
        {
          "track_id": "string",
          "time_segment": [start_time, end_time],
          "masks": ["string", ...]
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
The string IDs in "masks" can then be used to query the second JSON file (`scene-and-object-movements/mask_info.json`) for information on MP4 frame number, 3D location, bounding box and scene fixture of each object mask. The structure of this JSON object is as follows:
```jsonc
{
  "video_id": {
    "mask_id": {
      "frame_number": integer,
      "3d_location": [x, y, z],
      "bbox": [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax],
      "fixture": "string"
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
Each `mask_id` can be matched to a mask file name (e.g. `frame_id.png`) in the [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/f7hwei2m8y3ihlhp669h4/ALM8_1LDETY40O-06-ptr3A?rlkey=yrmqm3zk284htr5yjxb4z5nwp&e=1&st=815ovw6m&dl=0). It should be noted that the masks and bounding boxes were completed by different teams and therefore may be inconsistent in places.

**Field Descriptions**
- **`video_id`**: The name of the video, i.e. `P01-20240202-110250`
- **`association_id`**: A unique identifier for the object movement tracks
- **`name`**: The name of the association, i.e. `plate`
- **`tracks`**: A list of object movements that make up the association
- **`track_id`**: A unique identifier for the single movement of the object in the association
- **`time_segment`**: A start and end time for the single movement of the object in the association
- **`masks`**: A list of unique identifiers for each object mask connected to this particular movement of the object
- **`mask_id`**: A unique identifier for the object mask. This can be matched to a mask ID in the `masks` field of `assoc_info.json`, if this frame is connected to an association
- **`frame_number`**: The MP4 frame number for the particular frame, starting from 0 index.
- **`bbox`**: A four-element list specifying the 2D bounding box `[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax]`, i.e. `[693.1, 847.2, 775.00, 979.8]`.
- **`fixture`**: A string indicating the fixture the object is assigned to, i.e. `P01_cupboard.009` and `Null` if no assigned fixture.

## Eye Gaze Priming
We annotate priming moments when gaze anticipates object interactions—either by fixating on the pick-up location before the object is moved, or the placement location before it is put down. For pick-up priming, we project 3D gaze onto object locations within a 10-second window before the labelled interaction. For put-down priming, we use a similar window, starting either up to 10 seconds before placement or from the moment the object is lifted for shorter interactions. Near misses, where gaze is close but doesn’t directly intersect the object, are also captured using a proximity-based threshold. We exclude off-screen interactions and discard cases where gaze is already near the object long before motion starts, to avoid capturing ongoing manipulation.

Priming data is stored in a single JSON file (`eye_gaze_priming/priming_info.json`), where the top-level keys correspond to `video_ids`. Each value is a dictionary keyed by an object identifier (e.g. `"0"`, `"1"`, etc.), which contains information about the object’s pick-up (start) and put-down (end) events, along with associated priming metadata. The structure is as follows:
```jsonc
{
  "video_id": {
    "object_id": {
      "start": {
        "frame": integer,
        "3d_location": [x, y, z],
        "prime_stats": {
          "prime_window_start": integer,
          "frame_primed": integer,
          "gaze_point": [x, y, z],
          "dist_to_cam": float,
          "prime_gap": float
        }
      },
      "end": {
        "frame": integer,
        "3d_location": [x, y, z],
        "prime_stats": {
          "prime_window_start": integer,
          "frame_primed": integer,
          "gaze_point": [x, y, z],
          "dist_to_cam": float,
          "prime_gap": float
        }
      }
    },
    ...
  }
}
```
